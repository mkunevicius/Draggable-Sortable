# Drag & Sort

Simple interface with two containers. You can drag&drop blocks between containers and sort (change the order) blocks in the "Main Page" container, where they appear in bigger size. Callbacks with console.log added on each action in the interface. There is no back-end part for this, just a list of blocks in "Blocks" container, which can be used to create "Main Page" (it can be basically viewed as CMS blocs for building a website).
