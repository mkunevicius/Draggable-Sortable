# Drag & Sort

Simple interface with two containers for dragging and sorting blocks. You can drag&drop blocks to the "Main Page" container, where they appear in bigger size with possibility to sort (change order). Callbacks with console.log added on each action in the interface. There is no back-end part for this, just a list of blocks in "Blocks" container, which can be used to create "Main Page" (it can be basically viewed as CMS blocks for building a website).
